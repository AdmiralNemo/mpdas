================================================

mpdas is a MPD AudioCcrobbler client
supporting the 1.2.1 protocol specs.

It is written in C++ and uses libmpd
to retrieve the song data from MPD and
libcurl to post it to Last.fm

================================================

To configure mpdas, simple create a file called 
.mpdasrc in your home directory.

Syntax is easy. Example:

username = lastfmuser
password = 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

Whereas password is your Last.FM password hashed
with MD5.

Configuration options:

username:		Last.FM username
password:		Last.FM password (MD5 hashed)
host:			MPD Host
mpdpassword:		MPD Password
port:			MPD Port

================================================

Features:
- Sets now-playing status
- Scrobbling (obviously)
- Caching
- Config files

================================================

How to use it:
So far there is no configurgation
system or install rule. To set the 
account data, modify the config.h 
accordingly.
